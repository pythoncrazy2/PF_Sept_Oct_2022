What is High-Speed Rail?

, 17 (, 6-9-2017, accessed on 8-31-2022, High Speed Rail Alliance, "What is High-Speed Rail?", https://www.hsrail.org/what-high-speed-rail)

There is no fixed definition of high speed rail. It can be loosely defined as trains operating at speeds of at least 125 mph, with the fastest modern trains reaching speeds of about 220 mph. HSR is also defined by dedicated tracks and separated grade crossings, which dramatically reduce delays. And HSR is almost always part of a network of conventional and commuter trains, as well as transit systems. When all of these pieces are tightly coordinated and working in harmony, HSR creates a paradigm shift in travel options. 

High-speed rail is a proven technology, with operating networks in over 20 countries. We can draw upon those experiences to build networks that meet our needs. 

High-speed trains are a lot like regular trains, with steel wheels traveling over steel rails, but they use dedicated high-speed tracks and specialized train equipment to go really fast. Today's fastest trains regularly travel at 220 mph. (A French test train reached 357 mph, the current record.)**
